SickGear PostProcessing script for NZBGet
=========================================

If NZBGet v17+ is installed on the same system as SickGear then as a local install,

1) Add the location of this script file to NZBGet Settings/PATHS/ScriptDir

2) Navigate to any named TV category at Settings/Categories, click "Choose" Category.Extensions then Apply SickGear-NG

This is the best set up to automatically get script updates from SickGear

If NZBGet is installed on a different system to SickGear or NZBGet is v16 or earlier, then as a remote/older install,

1) Copy the directory with/or this single script file to path set in NZBGet Settings/PATHS/ScriptDir

2) Refresh the NZBGet page and navigate to Settings/SickGear-NG

3) Click View -> Compact to remove any tick and un hide tips and suggestions

4) The bare minimum change is the sg_base_path setting

5) Navigate to any named TV category at Settings/Categories, click "Choose" Category.Extensions then Apply SickGear-NG

You will need to manually update your script with this set up

Notes:
Debian doesn't have pip, _if_ requests is needed, try "apt install python-requests"
