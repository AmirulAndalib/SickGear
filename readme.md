<hr>

SickGear provides management of TV shows and/or Anime, it detects new episodes, links downloader apps, and more.

#### Important

* New features and updates are no longer available on this `develop` or `master` branch of SickGear
* Running the latest SickGear `develop` or `master` branch with Python 3 will automatically switch-over to the corresponding `dev` or `main` branch
* Alternatively, manually switching branch to either `dev` and `main` works too
* Official SickGear Docker images need a pull as the normal flow

The documentation normally viewed here has been moved to the  `dev` and `main` branch

Although support is available, you should understand the basics of your OS.  If you can't understand locating a db file, not running as root, or setting file permissions, then SickGear might not be for you.
